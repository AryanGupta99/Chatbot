# Password Reset - AceBuddy Knowledge Base

## Issue
User cannot access their account and needs a password reset.

## Symptoms
- User is locked out of their account
- Forgot their password
- Cannot log in to AceBuddy or related systems
- Last login was more than 30 days ago

## Automated Solution Overview
The AceBuddy chatbot automatically collects user details and sends a password reset request to the support team with all necessary information.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### For Users (via Chatbot)
1. User initiates chat: "I need to reset my password"
2. Chatbot asks for the following information:
   - Username or Account Name
   - Customer ID (CID)
   - Registered Email Address
   - Current Organization/Department

3. Chatbot verifies information against CRM data
4. If verification succeeds, chatbot sends automated email to support team
5. Support team receives email with:
   - User's full details
   - Timestamp of request
   - Suggested ETA: 15-30 minutes
6. User receives confirmation email with ETA and ticket number

### For Support Team
1. Receive automated ticket from chatbot
2. Verify user identity using CRM lookup
3. Generate temporary password or reset link
4. Send password reset link via email
5. Update ticket status to resolved

## Expected Outcome
- Faster password resets: 15-30 minute turnaround
- Reduced dependency on live agents
- Clear communication with customer
- All user details captured upfront
- No back-and-forth for clarification

## Time Savings
- Before: 10-15 minutes per ticket (with collection and verification)
- After: 5-7 minutes per ticket (support team only needs to process)
- Annual impact: ~1-2 hours saved per agent per month

## Success Criteria
- User receives confirmation within 1 minute
- Support team receives complete information in ticket
- Password reset completed within 30 minutes
- Zero escalations for missing information
