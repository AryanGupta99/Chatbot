## Automated Solution Overview
The AceBuddy chatbot collects all required user information through structured questions, then automatically creates a support ticket for the IT/HR team to process.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### For Users / Managers (via Chatbot)
1. User or manager initiates chat: "I need to add a new user" or "I need to delete a user"
2. Chatbot asks: "Are you adding a new user or deleting an existing user?"

**For User Addition:**
1. Chatbot collects information:
   - Full Name
   - Email Address (personal or company)
   - Customer ID (CID) or Account Number
   - Department/Role
   - Start Date
   - Manager Name
   - Access Level Required
   - Additional Systems Needed (QB, RDP, Email, etc.)

2. Chatbot captures information into support ticket
3. Chatbot confirms: "Sending user creation request to IT team"
4. Automated email sent to IT/HR with:
   - All user details
   - Start date
   - Required access levels
   - Manager approval reference
5. User receives confirmation email with ticket number
6. Expected turnaround: 1-2 business days

**For User Deletion:**
1. Chatbot collects information:
   - Employee Name
   - Last Working Date
   - Reason for Deletion (Resignation, Termination, Transfer, etc.)
   - Data Archival Required? (Yes/No)
   - Final access date
   - Manager Name/Approval

2. Chatbot captures information into support ticket
3. Automated email sent to IT/HR with:
   - User details
   - Last working date
   - Archival requirements
   - Access removal timeline
4. User receives confirmation email
5. Expected turnaround: Completed by last working date

### For IT/HR Team
1. Receive automated ticket from chatbot
2. Verify all required information is present
3. For additions:
   - Create user account
   - Set up email
   - Grant system access
   - Update employee directory
4. For deletions:
   - Archive user data if requested
   - Disable account
   - Revoke system access
